<h2>Installing</h2>

<a href="https://github.com/cal3432/software-inc-multiplayer/releases/tag/2.0.0-launcher"> Download the latest manager here.</a>

The manager is a desktop app you can use to install different versions of the mod, at a fast speed with no hassle. If you are having trouble using the installer, <a href="">follow this guide on how to manually install.</a>

<h2>How it works</h2>

The multiplayer mod is based on the Peer To Peer system currently, with dedicated servers coming soon.

First, the client connects to the server and sends their "GameWorld", which is their company, their stocks, etc.
Secondly, the client will recieve a collection of GameWorlds from the other clients and merges them with theirs, showing other players companies and their stocks etc.
Lastly, any changes will be sent to the server to be sent to the other clients and vice versa.
